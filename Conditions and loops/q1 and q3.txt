1. they enable a program to make decisions and perform different actions depending on the given conditions.
eg. If Statement:

let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
}

If-Else Statement:


let age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult");
} else {
    console.log("You are a minor");
}

3. Loops are control flow structures in programming that allow a set of instructions to be repeatedly executed as long as a certain condition is true.
For Loop:

Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
Example:

javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
While Loop:

Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
Example:

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
Do-While Loop:

Syntax:


do {
    // Code to be executed at least once, and then repeated as long as the condition is true
} while (condition);
Example:


let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
