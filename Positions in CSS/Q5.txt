Z-Index:
	It defines the stack order of the elemrnt. The more the value it will positioned front. It works on positioned and flex 
elements.

Eg.

<body>
	<img URL>
	<p>ohckoajfkjaskldfjsajdf;l</p>
</body>
<style>
img{
position: relative
z-index: -1;
}
</style>

 In this case Image will be rendered behind the paragraph since it is less than para's index
