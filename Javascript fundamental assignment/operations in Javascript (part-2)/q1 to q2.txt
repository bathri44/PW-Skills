1 The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement in a single line. 

eg. odd or even
	let number=3;
	(number % 2 === 0) ? `${number} is even.` : `${number} is odd.`;


2. comma is used to evaluate multiple expressions within a single statement.

eg. let a,b,c:
    a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
    console.log(a, b, c);
