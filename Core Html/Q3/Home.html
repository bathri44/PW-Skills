    <h1>Bathri Narayanan R</h1>
    <p>Hi, My name is Bathri Narayanan. I am from Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Finished my bachelors in engineering in Material Science and Engineering from a college affliated under Anna university. Currently working as an Admissions Counsellor in a reputed Ed-tech company. I do have interest
        in computers and coding from school days. Apart from that I am a ardent cricket fan, PC Gamer, watch lot of series and movies. Currently
        enrolled in FSD course from PW Skills to learn and get a career in tech. I was planning to a career in tech from school days, but unfortunately I cant pursue. Now this course will help me to
        get a career in tech I think.
